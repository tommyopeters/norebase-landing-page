            possible.
          </p>
          <h4>WHY WE COLLECT YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
          <p>
            It is very important to understand that we do not request any
            personal data with respect to your person other than that which we
            need in order to satisfy legal requirements and assist you in your
            needs or data which you choose to provide us yourself when you
            request our services.
          </p>
          <p>
            Apart from the data collected to be able to provide you with the
            service requested, we will also collect data that is legally
            required from us to collect and to keep for a certain period of time
            as well as any data that we think is in our legitimate interests to
            ask for.
          </p>
          <p>
            The purpose for which we collect your data is varied which include
            the following:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>In order to fulfil your order;</li>
            <li>Send you an order confirmation;</li>
            <li>
              Assess your needs and that of your business to determine suitable
              products;
            </li>
            <li>Send you the requested product or information;</li>
            <li>Reply to customer service requests;</li>
            <li>Keep an open communication with you;</li>
            <li>Site optimization and application troubleshooting;</li>
            <li>
              Invoice and charge you for applicable service fees, including
              debiting your card in accordance with the applicable Terms and
              Conditions;
            </li>
            <li>Conduct due diligence on yourself and/or your company; and</li>
            <li>Reply to your queries and concerns.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Hence, as you can notice, data would be processed to fulfil an
            obligation that we have with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kindly note that if data shall be processed for a new purpose other
            than the ones above mentioned, we shall immediately inform you.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will not use the information provided for any other commercial
            purpose other than the one you requested.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is also important to highlight that if certain data is not
            provided to us, then we might be unable to provide you with the
            service you require.
          </p>
          <h4>SHARING YOUR INFORMATION WITH THIRD PARTIES</h4>
          <p>
            Personal data shall be shared with adequate and authorized personnel
            of Norebase and with any of our service providers who would
            facilitate the usage of the Sites whereby they would assist us with
            our business activities such as the processing of your order or
            payment, the registration of your business or any customer service.
            Personal data would only be shared in order for us to provide you
            with the requested service except we have a lawful reason to share
            the data which does not necessarily require your consent.
          </p>
          <h4>HOW WE SAFEGUARD YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
          <p>
            We use reasonable efforts to safeguard the confidentiality of all
            personal data that we process relating to you and regularly review
            and enhance our technical, physical and managerial procedures so as
            to ensure that your personal data is protected from unauthorized
            access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized modification, and
            unlawful destruction or accidental loss.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this respect, kindly be informed that we have implemented
            security policies, rules as well as technical measures to protect
            the personal data that we have under our control. All our employees
            and data processors, who have access to and are associated with the
            processing of personal data, are further obliged to respect the
            confidentiality of our visitors’ personal data.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you enter sensitive information (such as debit/credit card,
            bank account or proprietary business information) on our Ordering
            Document, we encrypt the transmission of that information using
            secure socket layer technology (SSL) as a security measure.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to the security measures we employ, you must also ensure
            that you take responsibility for the protection of your personal
            information. We will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by
            the activities of hackers and fraudsters when we have taken all
            necessary and reasonable steps to protect your information in our
            possession. You are fully responsible for safeguarding your
            username, password, and financial information.
          </p>
          <h4>DATA RETENTION PERIOD</h4>
          <p>
            We shall take into consideration the purpose for which the data
            shall be obtained in order to understand for how long we can retain
            your personal data. Data shall only be retained for as long as it is
            necessary. In order to come to define the latter, we shall look at
            the data we have collected on yourself as well as the relationship
            we have with you.
          </p>
          <p>
            When your data is no longer needed, we shall proceed to delete it or
            else we shall anonymize it in order to not be able to link the data
            with an identifiable person.
          </p>
          <p>
            The length of storage of Personal Data shall, amongst other things,
            be determined by:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              the contract terms agreed between Norebase and the Data Subject or
              as long as it is needed for the purpose for which it was obtained;
              or
            </li>
            <li>
              whether the transaction or relationship has statutory implication
              or a required retention period; or
            </li>
            <li>
              whether there is an express request for deletion of Personal Data
              by the Data Subject, provided that such request will only be
              treated where the Data Subject is not under any investigation
              which may require Norebase to retain such Personal Data or there
              is no subsisting contractual arrangement with the Data Subject
              that would require the processing of the Personal Data; or
            </li>
            <li>
              Whether Norebase has another lawful basis for retaining that
              information beyond the period for which it is necessary to serve
              the original purpose.
            </li>
          </ul>
